# Procedure

## Step 1: Requirements Clarification
- Description
   - Ask questions about the exact scope of the problem.
   - Clarify what parts of the system we will be focusing on.
   - The interviewer either answers the question or asks you to make assumptions.
- Sub-steps
   - Step 1.1: Functional requirements
      - Read actions
      - Write actions
      - Other functional behaviors 
   - Step 1.2: Non-functional requirements
      - Platforms
         - Which kind of platforms need to support? Mobile, web, etc.
      - Consistency
         - Which kind of consistency level need to achieve? Strict consistency or eventual consistency.
      - Availability
         - Which kind of availability level need to achieve? high availablity or low availablity is acceptable.
      - Performance
         - Which kind of performance level need to achieve? Minimal latency or long latency is acceptable.
      - User volume
         - How many users? How many Daily Active Users (DAU)?
         

## Step 2: Estimation
- Description
   - Estimate the scale of the system weâ€™re going to design.
- Sub-steps
   - Step 2.1: Estimate traffic/usage
      - Identify the system is read-heavy or write-heavy.
         - Estimate read-write ratio (The ratio between read actions and write actions).
      - Estimate the total number of users and Daily Active Users (DAU)
         - USER_NUM.
      - Estimate the number of read actions and write actions per user per month/week/day.
         - ACTION_NUM_PER_USER.
      - Estimate the total number of read actions and write actions for the system per month/week/day.
         - ACTION_NUM_PER_SYSTEM = USER_NUM X ACTION_NUM_PER_USER
      - Estimate the frequencies of read actions and write actions per second (QPS).
         - QPS = ACTION_NUM_PER_SYSTEM / TIME
   - Step 2.2: Estimate storage
      - Estimate the types of storages 
         - Database
         - Object storages
      - Estimate the capacity of storage
         - Data size generated by one write action.
            - DATA_RECORD_SIZE.
         - Total storage we need for the system per month/week/day
            - STORAGE = WRITE_ACTION_NUM_PER_SYSTEM x DATA_RECORD_SIZE
   - Step 2.3: Estimate bandwidth
      - Calculate write bandwidth
         - WRITE_BANDWIDTH = STORAGE / TIME
      - Calculate read bandwidth
         - READ_BANDWIDTH = QPS x DATA_RECORD_SIZE

## Step 3: System interface definition
- Description
   - Define what APIs are expected from the system.
- Example
  ```
  executeAction1(param1_1, param1_2, param1_3)
  executeAction2(param2_1, param2_2, param2_3)
  executeAction2(param3_1, param3_2, param3_3)
  ```
- Recommendations
   - If an interface is for registered accounts only, add `api_key` as a parameter.

## Step 4: Data model definition
- Description
   - Identify tables and how they will interact with each other.
- Sub-steps
   - Step 4.1: Build the schema.
      - Tables
      - Columns and column type
      - Foreign key relationship between tables
   - Step 4.2: Choose a proper database and other storage.
      - Database: SQL or NoSQL database ([see more]([https://github.com/wuyichen24/system-design-knowledge/blob/master/components/Database.md#relational-and-non-relational-database](https://github.com/wuyichen24/system-design-knowledge/blob/master/components/database/Database_Types.md))).
      - Object storage: Store photos and videos.
      - [Non-technical factors need to be considered for selecting a storage solution](https://github.com/wuyichen24/system-design-knowledge/blob/master/best_practices/Non_Technical_Factors_Need_To_Be_Considered_For_Selecting_Storage_Solution.md)

## Step 5: High-level design
- Description
   - Draw a block diagram with 5-6 boxes representing the core components of our system.
- Common core components
   - Client/User
   - Load balancer
   - Application server
   - Database
   - File storage

## Step 6: Detailed Design
- Description
   - Dig deeper into two or three major components.
   - Provide different options, their pros and cons, and explain why we will prefer one approach over the other.

## Step 7: Identify and solve bottlelnecks
- Description
   - Identify potential bottlenecks
   - Provide solutions for the bottlenecks
- Common bottlenecks
   - Performance bottleneck
   - Single point of failure
